                Our initial plan is to create a simulation of a guitar string vibrating in a particle based air
                environment.
                We aim to demonstrate how the air particles are influenced by the vibrations of the string.

            <h3>Update 1 - Fluid simulation</h3>
            <h6>2025-02-24</h6>

            <p>
                For the first update we mostly followed the video by Sebastian Lague.
                The fluid is affected by a "pressure force" that make the particles want to create an equal pressure
                everywhere.
                The pressure is calculated by using the density of particles around each particle.
                This will then make the particles move away from areas with high density.
                The influence a particle has on the density is calculated with smooth particle hydrodynamics.
                <br><br>
                To keep the fluid within the area we check if a particle is outside the bounds and put the position to
                the bound and reverse the velocity in that case.
                The velocity is also reduced with damping factor.
                To make sure the fluid is affected by the rectangle we check if the particle is within the rectangle,
                and in that case we move it to the closest side of the rectangle.
                As with the outer bounds the velocity is reversed when the particle is within the rectangle.

                We will start working on the string, find a way to make the string particles collide with the fluid and
                improve the current fluid.

            <h3>Update 2 - Simulating instrument string</h3>
            <h6>2025-03-04</h6>

            <p>
                In this update, we worked on our simulation of the instrument string. We initialy shifted our focus from the idea
                of a mass-spring system to a digital waveguide model. From our understanding after reading up on current
                research, mostly from Stefan Bilbao, digital waveguide-based simulations are a better option to produce
                a realistic and stable result while maintaining low computational cost. 
            </p>

            <p>
                *Edit: After some consideration we decided to go back to the mass-spring system for the string simulation. After undersanding more the pros and cons of waveguide-based simulations, we realised that while the waveguide is more accurate and efficient for simulating the sound of an instrument-string, it really does not lend itself to the visual side of the simulation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The classical one-dimensional wave equation is given by:
            </p>

            <p class="math">
                μ ∂²u/∂t² - T ∂²u/∂x² = 0
            </p>
            <p>
                In this equation:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>μ</code> (mu) is the mass per unit length of the string, representing how much mass is distributed along the string.</li>
                    <li><code>∂²u/∂t²</code> is the second partial derivative of displacement <code>u</code> with respect to time <code>t</code>, representing the acceleration of the string.</li>
                    <li><code>T</code> is the tension in the string, which is the force that is trying to pull the string back to its equilibrium position.</li>
                    <li><code>∂²u/∂x²</code> is the second partial derivative of displacement <code>u</code> with respect to position <code>x</code>, representing the curvature of the string.</li>
                    <li>The equation <code>μ ∂²u/∂t² - T ∂²u/∂x² = 0</code> describes the balance between the inertial forces (left term) and the restoring forces due to tension (right term).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                In our current implementation:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>String2DSimulation</code> leverages digital waveguide techniques to simulate the propagation
                    of waves along the string.</li>
                <li><code>stringSimulation.cs</code> has been created to handle boundary conditions and
                    collisions.</li>
            </ul>

                Next update we will focus on integrating the string simulation with the fluid simulation. The goal is to create
                an interactive environment where the string vibrations influence the air particles shown in the last blog
                post.

            <h3>Update 3 - Updating the fluid</h3>
            <h6>2025-03-05</h6>
            <p>
                Since the last post on the fluid some changes have been made in accordance with the literature on the topic. We have added a visocosity force and better boundaries around the fluid. 
                <br><br>
                The smoothing kernels have not been explained so far so below is a picture of our current choice, the pressure kernel is in red and the viscosity kernel is in black. 
            </p>
            <figure class="center bordered">
                <img src="public/smoothKernel.png" alt="[Placeholder alt text]">
            </figure>

            <p>
                In our weakly compressible fluid the translation between density and pressure is done through this function <code>k<sub>p</sub>(ρ - ρ<sub>0</sub>)</code> 
                where <code>k<sub>p</sub></code> is the pressure multiplier, <code>ρ</code> is the particle's density, and <code>ρ<sub>0</sub></code> is the target density of the fluid.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fluid particles are now updated according to the code below. 
            </p>

            <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
// Update sequence called each frame
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Predict position from current velocity
    // Calculate the density at the predicted position
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Calculate viscosity force
    // Get viscosity acceleration
    // Update particle velocity
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Calculate pressure force
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Get pressure acceleration 
    // Update particle velocity
    // Check that each particle is within the bounds
}
            </code>

            <p>
                In the video below the brown particles are used as a boundary, they each influence the pressure force on each of the fluid particles. 
                Once the fluid has viscosity the waves that form are more visible compared to the previous fluid video.

            <h3>Update 4 - Finalizing our simulation</h3>
            <h6>2025-03-17</h6>

            <p>
            We have now submitted our final project. 
            </p>
            <p>
            During our last two weeks, we focused on trying to integrate the string with the fluid-based particle system.
            </p>

        

         

            <p>
                This is where we ran into our biggest issues of this project. Turns out, handling collisions between the string and fluid particles in a way that wasn't too slow for the simulation to work was a real challange. Who would have guessed. 😅 </p>
                <p>
                    At the start, we tried this naive method where every particle had to check how far it was from every other particle in the simulation. When trying to piece the simulations together, we realised, that was a bit… ugh, too costly, and it made the simulation very unstable. Sometimes the string would start vibrating uncontrollably and break. Sometimes the simulation was not able to handle the collisions fast enough, so that the string would just go through many of the particles. Which you can still see some remnants of in the video below.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, to solve this and make the simulation faster, we decided to split the space into a grid of cells. Each cell keeps track of what particles and string bits are inside, way less collisions to check now!
            </p>




            <figure class="center bordered">
                <video width="80%" height="400" controls>
                    <source src="public/particle-string-interaction.mov" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
            </figure>

            <p>
                After adding this grid-based collision, we've succeeded—kinda—in getting our string simulation working with the fluid particles together. Now we can show how the string vibrates and how waves form and flow through the particles.
            </p> 

            <p>
                Our simulation has changed a lot from the beginning. We started with basic fluid simulation, and now we have this whole system loosely simulating how a string vibrates and how the air particles around it move.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the future we would love to be able to come back to this simulation, using more compute to be able to simulate a greater amount of particles. Where you really could visualize the wave behavior even better.

            <p>
                We've learned a lot during this project and we hope that you reading this, got some interesting insight into mass-spring systems and particle simulation or perhaps some new ideas for your own simulations.
            </p>

                Thanks for checking out our project!
